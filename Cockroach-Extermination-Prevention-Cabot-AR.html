Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>

<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a sustainable and broad-based  method that incorporates practices for the financial prevention and control of pests and illness in crops.
