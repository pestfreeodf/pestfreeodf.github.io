<p>Select an effective management approach that will have the least quantity of effect on other living creatures and the environment if a pest or disease causes inappropriate damage regardless of preventative efforts. Examples consist of cultivation of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, choice of planting sites, trap crops, and changing the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the safest for other organisms and for air, water, and soil quality; usage pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds rather of an entire location. Due to any variety of reasons, including those pointed out in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the efficiency of natural opponents frequently permits possible pest organisms to experience virtually unregulated population development and allows them to reach pest status. </p>
