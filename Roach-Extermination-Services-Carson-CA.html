<p>IPM programs work to keep an eye on for pests and identify them precisely, so that suitable control choices can be made in combination with action limits. Nevertheless, the significant trend has actually been toward using modern chemistry and molecular biology to change traditional pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; but these ways are still therapies.</p>
